### TL;DR
- I architect global large-scale technology transformations. I thrive in complexity ⇒ I have a passionate drive to simplify it.
- I am a grounded, hands-on technologist, Data, AI & CRM expert, a rapid and forever learner, a strategic big-picture thinker, and a pragmatic innovator who can rapidly crystallize concepts into products and platforms. 
- Currently, I am laser-focused on getting Agentic CRM capabilities (Sales, Servicing, Marketing), built on a core Data & AI foundation, live at scale in production within the largest/complex customers in regulated industries - Financial Services & Insurance, and to some extent Life Sciences & Healthcare.
- I bring a fresh, outside-in perspective to help understand and solve the core technology challenges to create & deliver genuinely transformative experiences, products, and ecosystems.
- **Mentor**: Very passionate about learning & teaching, particularly Women in Computing after my experiences [attending Grace Hopper Conference](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-i-learnt-grace-hopper-celebration-2018-hitesh-seth/). I am passionate about learning, building, coaching, and enabling high-performance teams to thrive in an agile product-centric culture.
- **Data, AI, ML, GenAI, Agents**: I’m deeply passionate about modern data platforms, data architecture and engineering, and the transformative power of AI/ML, GenAI, and agent-based systems. I’ve applied this expertise in highly complex and regulated industries such as financial services and medicine.
- **APIs & Integration**: I’ve long championed the power of integrated systems to solve complex, large-scale challenges. From early in my career, I’ve specialized in connecting internal and external platforms using a wide range of integration technologies—including CORBA, SOAP, REST, APIs, GraphQL, MQ, message/event-driven frameworks, Kafka, etc. My approach combines architectural rigor with practical execution to ensure system interoperability, resilience, and scalability.
- **Security**: I guess having worked in FINS, Life Sciences, I am fairly intense on security. In addition to my usual "Chief Architect" roles for the businesses that I supported, I always used to play a "CISO" type role for my extended teams... :slightly_smiling_face: Learnt a lot from interacting closely with my CISOs and thoroughly enjoyed learning/sharing.
- **Patents**: Have granted many patents in the world of eCommerce, mobile payments, etc, included below...

- I have a deep passion in applying Data/AI/ML experience on medicine, that's why I joined IQVIA, and enjoyed my time supporting bringing COVID vaccines to market in record time... but then realized that the company was a relatively slow-moving and rather not aggressive (in terms of investments) organization without the urgency of COVID... I wrote this [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hiteshseth_thankyou-activity-6969720217895628801-4Ov4/) after I left IQVIA.
